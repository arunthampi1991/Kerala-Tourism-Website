            <h1>Kannur<br></h1><h4>(Est. - 1 Jan 1957)</h4>

            <p>
                Kannur, formerly Cannanore, is a northern district of Kerala. It shares its boundaries with the Kasaragod District of Kerala on the North and the Kozhikode District of Kerala in The South. To the east is the State of Karnataka and to the West is the Arabian Sea. The district derives its name from the city of Kannur, which is its headquarters. Kannur is famous for its extraordinary natural beauty, its dainty beaches, ancient temples and the associated festival rituals like the Theyyam. The major industries,
                 besides tourism, are the handloom and choir work industries.

                    <p1>The impeccably unspoilt Payyabalam beach is adorned with sparkling pearls of golden sand and foamy white waves of the Arabian Sea. The highlight of Kannur and one of the many beautiful beaches of Kerala,
                         it has an incredibly peaceful and inviting aura.

                            St Angelo's Fort </h3>

                    <p1>  
                        St Angelo's Fort is definitely one of the most popular and frequently visited attractions of Kannur and for more reasons than one. The polished yet prehistoric structure of this fortress oozes with unadulterated elegance and overwhelming power. Standing ashore in the Arabian sea, it enjoys a panoramic and unobstructed view of the diorama created by
                         the merger of the magnetic waves and the azure waters.
